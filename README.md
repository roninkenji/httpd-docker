  The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful and flexible HTTP/1.1 compliant
  web server.  Originally designed as a replacement for the NCSA HTTP
  Server, it has grown to be the most popular web server on the
  Internet.  As a project of the Apache Software Foundation, the
  developers aim to collaboratively develop and maintain a robust,
  commercial-grade, standards-based server with freely available
  source code.
